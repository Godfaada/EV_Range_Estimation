Estimation of the Range of an Electric Vehicle Using Machine Learning.
In recent years, global warming has attracted the attention of several governments across the world. Urban transportation and road traffic has been cited as one of the major factors driving the global CO2 emissions to its astronomically high levels. In 2020, the transport sector was identified to be contributing about 24% of the total global CO2 emission with road vehicles accounting for almost a quarter of that value. The consequences of these emissions are being felt each passing day. As a result of this, the Paris Agreement was adopted in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) a legally binding international treaty between signed by 196 parties. Its primary goal is to combat global warming and transition to a low-carbon future. In line with these developments, there has been an insurgence in Electric Vehicles as a measure to attain the net zero emission target set by some governments across the world. The International Energy Agency (International Energy Agency, 2024) has indicated that as at 2024, there has been about 17 million EVs sold. They however projected that the number shall rise to about 105 million by 2035. This further highlights the rate at which EVs are becoming a core part of our road transport system.
These Electric Vehicles rely heavily on Lithium-ion batteries due to their high energy density, long life cycle as well as high operating temperature. There are however some issues which are hindering the penetration of the EVs into the market. These include, battery degradation, cell inconsistencies and thermal runaway during overcharge. The Battery State of Health (SOH) is a measure of the capacity of the battery. However, the precise estimation of the SOH is a quite complex due to the non-linear nature of the battery. The internal chemical reactions result in the formation of Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) films. The uneven load current and thermal distribution further induce cell inconsistency which even cause battery thermal runaway accidents. The level of cell inconsistency can be reflected by the variations in the output energy, terminal voltage, temperature, SOC, etc. Therefore, to some extent these variables may indicate the state of the battery. These battery degradation factors as well as the difficulty in the estimation of SOH has rendered the accurate prediction of the remaining range of an EV quite challenging. This leads to ‘‘range anxiety’’ of drivers, which is defined as the psychological anxiety that drivers suffer from worrying about whether their EV can arrive at the destination before exhausting the battery (LIANG ZHAO 1, 2020). The charging infrastructure of EVs are also now being established in their numbers and hence this further magnifies the issue of range anxiety amongst drivers. It is therefore very important to estimate the remaining range of the EVs to deal with this anxiety issue as well as to make the EVs a dependable means of transport. The range of an EV is conceptually equivalent to the fuel gauge of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle and hence it cannot be underestimated.
This project focuses on the accurate estimation of the range of EVs using Machine Learning. To predict the remaining range, we usually combine the prediction of the energy consumption rate and the remaining capacity of the battery. The latter is typically represented by the State of Charge (SOC) of the battery. The energy consumption rate is affected by several factor such as the speed, driving patterns, braking frequency, acceleration frequency, battery temperature and even the weight of the vehicle. To estimate the energy consumption rate, some existing work in literature focuses on some external factors such as external temperate which influences the battery’s operation as well as the slope of the road. It is however obvious that it is impossible to comprehensively consider all these external factors making the task of gauging the range of EVs even more daunting. It is worth noting that these factors vary with time as well. There are public data available. These data are composed of (David Albuquerque, 2023) vehicle data and trip data, with mainly two types of features: time-series features, where the data points vary as a function of time; trip-invariant features, in which a given value is kept for the entire trip. Time-series features are usually the SoC, energy consumption, speed, acceleration, and elevation. These time-series data are ordered chronologically The trip-invariant features refer to vehicle information such as battery capacity, average energy consumption (AEC), full battery energy (FBE), full driving distance (FDD) also known as full battery distance (FBD), vehicle weight, trip information such as commute type (city or highway), total energy consumption, and total distance (David Albuquerque, 2023).

From existing literature, several Machine Learning models have been used to estimate the range of an EV. These include ; Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) which is effective for handling multiple factors and achieving high accuracy. Regression Models: Including linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), and regression trees, suitable for continuous range predictions. Neural Networks: Such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and deep neural networks, used for capturing complex temporal and spatial patterns. Hybrid Models: Combinations like Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with regression trees or ensemble methods (e.g., random forests) to enhance prediction accuracy. Fuzzy Logic and Probabilistic Models: Applied for real-time estimation and modelling uncertainty in dynamic conditions. The training data must be a structured data organized as a time-series or tabular data set. The features normally include numerical variables such as Battery State of Charge (SOC), voltage, current, motor power, vehicle speed, acceleration, temperature, wind speed and road slope. It also contains categorical variables such as the road type (highway, urban etc.), drive train type or driving style (eco-driving, aggressive etc.). Data is often collected from onboard diagnostics (OBD), controller area network (CAN) systems, GPS or external APIs such as weather and traffic. It may also include data argumentation to enhance the real-world dataset maintaining consistency in feature representation. The amount of training data required usually varies. There can be small to medium data sets which includes thousands of trip records often from public sources. There can also be large data set of extensive real world or argumented datasets containing millions of data points covering diverse driving scenarios and conditions for improving the robustness of the model. Currently, the availability of pretrained models specifically for EV range estimation is limited. However, pretrained models in frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras can be fine-tuned for EV range estimation.We can also consider the models used is the referenced papers in our work. Although they are not specific to EV range, they can be adapted with custom data set including vehicle parameters, environmental factors and driving behavior. Some studies suggest using transfer learning with models pretrained on related task such as battery SOC estimation to initialize range prediction models. However, this requires custom adoption to incorporate EV specific features like speed, acceleration and environmental conditions.
