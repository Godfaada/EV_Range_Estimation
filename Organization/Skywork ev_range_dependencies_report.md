# Dependency Analysis and Formula Development for Electric Vehicle Range Prediction

---

## 1. Relationship Between Vehicle Speed and EV Energy Consumption

### Key Insights
- **Aerodynamic drag force** increases approximately with the square of vehicle speed (\(F_d \propto v^2\)), making speed a dominant factor in energy consumption.
- Energy consumption per distance rises exponentially with speed due to drag and rolling resistance.
- Optimal speed ranges exist where energy consumption per km is minimized (typically 40–60 km/h for many EVs).
- High speeds (>80 km/h) drastically reduce range due to increased drag power demand.

### Quantitative Relationship
The aerodynamic drag power \(P_d\) is given by:

\[
P_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^3
\]

Where:
- \(\rho\) = air density (kg/m³)
- \(C_d\) = drag coefficient (dimensionless)
- \(A\) = frontal area (m²)
- \(v\) = vehicle speed (m/s)

Since power is force times velocity, drag force scales with \(v^2\), and power with \(v^3\).

### Supporting Data
- Studies (Varga et al., 2019; MDPI, 2023) confirm strong correlation between speed and energy consumption.
- Energy consumption can increase by 20–40% when speed increases from 50 km/h to 100 km/h.

---

## 2. Impact of Acceleration and Deceleration on EV Range

### Key Insights
- Frequent acceleration/deceleration cycles increase transient power demand, raising energy consumption.
- Regenerative braking recovers some energy during deceleration but is not 100% efficient.
- Aggressive driving with rapid acceleration reduces range significantly.

### Quantitative Relationship
Energy consumption due to acceleration can be approximated by kinetic energy changes:

\[
E_{acc} = \frac{1}{2} m (v_f^2 - v_i^2)
\]

Where:
- \(m\) = vehicle mass (kg)
- \(v_i, v_f\) = initial and final speeds (m/s)

Net energy consumption accounts for regenerative braking efficiency \(\eta_{regen}\):

\[
E_{net} = E_{acc} \times (1 - \eta_{regen})
\]

Typical \(\eta_{regen}\) ranges from 50% to 70%.

### Supporting Data
- MDPI (2023), Kim et al. (2022) show acceleration correlates strongly with battery power draw.
- Avoiding rapid acceleration can improve range by 5–15%.

---

## 3. Influence of Vehicle Weight and Aerodynamics on Energy Efficiency

### Vehicle Weight
- Heavier vehicles require more energy for acceleration and climbing.
- Rolling resistance force \(F_r\) is proportional to vehicle weight:

\[
F_r = m g C_r
\]

Where:
- \(g\) = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- \(C_r\) = rolling resistance coefficient (~0.01–0.015)

- A 15% increase in vehicle weight can cause a 4–9% increase in energy consumption (ScienceDirect, 2025).

### Aerodynamics
- Drag coefficient \(C_d\) and frontal area \(A\) directly affect aerodynamic drag power (see Section 1).
- Streamlined designs reduce \(C_d\) and improve range.

---

## 4. HVAC Energy Consumption Patterns in EVs

### Key Insights
- HVAC systems are among the largest auxiliary loads, especially in extreme temperatures.
- HVAC can reduce driving range by 20–40%.
- Energy consumption depends on ambient temperature, solar heat gain, and HVAC system efficiency.

### Quantitative Modeling
HVAC power consumption \(P_{HVAC}\) can be modeled as:

\[
P_{HVAC} = f(T_{ambient}, T_{set}, Q_{solar}, \eta_{HVAC})
\]

Where:
- \(T_{ambient}\) = outside temperature
- \(T_{set}\) = cabin set temperature
- \(Q_{solar}\) = solar heat gain
- \(\eta_{HVAC}\) = HVAC system efficiency

Dynamic models (ResearchGate, 2014; MDPI, 2023) simulate HVAC load variation over time.

---

## 5. Elevation/Slope Effects on EV Energy Usage

### Key Insights
- Uphill driving increases energy consumption due to gravitational work.
- Downhill driving can recover energy via regenerative braking.
- Slope impact can improve energy consumption estimation accuracy by 5–8%.

### Quantitative Relationship
Gravitational power component:

\[
P_{slope} = m g v \sin(\theta)
\]

Where:
- \(\theta\) = road slope angle (radians)

Energy over distance \(\Delta d\):

\[
E_{slope} = m g \sin(\theta) \Delta d
\]

---

## 6. Ambient Temperature Effects on Battery Performance

### Key Insights
- Battery efficiency and capacity degrade outside optimal temperature range (~15–35°C).
- Cold temperatures increase internal resistance, reducing available energy and increasing HVAC heating demand.
- Hot temperatures increase cooling load and can reduce battery lifespan.

### Quantitative Effects
- Range can drop by 20–40% in cold weather (Vaisala, 2024; Geotab, 2023).
- Battery capacity \(C_{bat}\) and efficiency \(\eta_{bat}\) are temperature-dependent:

\[
C_{bat}(T) = C_{nominal} \times f(T)
\]

\[
\eta_{bat}(T) = \eta_{nominal} \times g(T)
\]

Where \(f(T)\) and \(g(T)\) are empirically derived temperature correction factors.

## 7. Comprehensive Formula Framework for Synthetic EV Range Prediction Data Generation

### Overview

The total energy consumption \(EC\) for a trip segment can be modeled as the sum of propulsion energy, auxiliary loads (including HVAC), and regenerative energy recovery:

\[
EC = EC_{propulsion} + EC_{auxiliary} + EC_{HVAC} - EC_{regenerative}
\]

Where each term is detailed below.

---

### 7.1  

\[
EC_{propulsion} = \sum \left[ \left( F_{aero} + F_{roll} + F_{gravity} + F_{acc} \right) \times \Delta d \right] / \eta_{drivetrain}
\]

With forces:

| Force            | Formula                                      | Description                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Aerodynamic Drag | \(F_{aero} = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d A v^2\)   | Air resistance                     |
| Rolling Resistance | \(F_{roll} = m g C_r \cos(\theta)\)         | Tire-road friction                 |
| Gravitational    | \(F_{gravity} = m g \sin(\theta)\)           | Road slope effect                 |
| Acceleration     | \(F_{acc} = m a\)                             | Inertial force from acceleration  |

- \(\Delta d\) = distance increment
- \(\eta_{drivetrain}\) = drivetrain efficiency (~0.85–0.95)

---

### 7.2 Auxiliary Loads (excluding HVAC)

Includes lighting, infotainment, electronics:

\[
EC_{auxiliary} = P_{aux} \times \Delta t
\]

Where \(P_{aux}\) is average auxiliary power (typically 100–500 W).

---

### 7.3 HVAC Energy Consumption

Modeled dynamically as:

\[
EC_{HVAC} = \sum P_{HVAC}(t) \times \Delta t
\]

Where \(P_{HVAC}(t)\) depends on ambient temperature, solar load, and HVAC system state.

---

### 7.4 Regenerative Energy Recovery

\[
EC_{regenerative} = \eta_{regen} \times \sum \frac{1}{2} m (v_i^2 - v_f^2) \quad \text{for } v_i > v_f
\]

---

### 7.5 Initial Battery State of Charge (SoC) and Temperature Adjustment

The usable battery energy \(E_{usable}\) is:

\[
E_{usable} = C_{bat}(T) \times SoC_{init} \times V_{bat}
\]

Where:
- \(SoC_{init}\) = initial state of charge (fraction)
- \(V_{bat}\) = nominal battery voltage

---

### 7.6 Final Range Estimation

The predicted range \(R\) is:

\[
R = \frac{E_{usable}}{EC_{per\_km}}
\]

Where \(EC_{per\_km}\) is average energy consumption per km derived from the above components.

# Conclusion

Electric vehicle range prediction depends on a complex interplay of vehicle dynamics, environmental conditions, and auxiliary systems. Speed and acceleration dominate propulsion energy consumption through aerodynamic drag and inertial forces. Vehicle weight and aerodynamics further modulate these effects. HVAC systems impose significant auxiliary loads, especially under extreme temperatures, which also affect battery performance and capacity. Elevation changes introduce gravitational energy demands and opportunities for regenerative braking.

The comprehensive formula framework presented integrates these dependencies into a modular model suitable for synthetic data generation. This enables realistic simulation of EV energy consumption and range under diverse driving and environmental scenarios, supporting robust model training and validation.
